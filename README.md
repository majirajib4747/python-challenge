# python-challenge
For PyBank exercise , it is not matching the actual output with expected result mentioned in Challenge Document. 
For PyBank I had used a different Function to calculate the summary 
For Pypoll program , similarly I had used a function to build a Dictionary for each candidate. and at the end proint out the result as well written into files.
